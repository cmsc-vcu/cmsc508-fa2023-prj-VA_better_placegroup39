# Reports Folder

The "Reports" folder in this project serves as a repository for deliverable reports associated with various project milestones. To maintain organization and clarity, a consistent naming convention for these report files, such as "deliverableX.qmd," where "X" represents the corresponding milestone number is used.

## Naming Convention

For each deliverable report, the following naming convention is used:

- **Deliverable 4:** `deliverable4.qmd`
- **Deliverable 5:** `deliverable5.qmd`
- **And so on for subsequent deliverables.**

By adhering to this naming convention, we ensure that reports are easily identifiable and linked to the specific milestones they correspond to.

## Report Formats

The "Reports" folder may contain reports in various formats, including but not limited to:

- Markdown (`.md`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Word (`.docx`)
- HTML (`.html`)
- LaTeX (`.tex`)
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)


## Usage

To access a specific report, simply navigate to the appropriate file within this folder. You can click on the file to view its contents or download it if necessary.
