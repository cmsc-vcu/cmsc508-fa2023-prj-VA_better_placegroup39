# Virginia Better Place

## Project Description

The Virginia Better Place Database is a comprehensive resource for assessing and comparing living conditions across different counties in Virginia. It provides data on various aspects, including education, housing, employment, crime activity, transportation, and population. With this database, you can explore and analyze living conditions to make informed decisions.

## Problem domain
* There are a lot of factors that come into consideration when moving from one place to another and a new place can be overwhelming when looking at all the data needed to ingest to make a decision where it is for a 3 month move or permanent relocation this application provides important data to help a user rank where the best zip code is to move. Scouring all the internet for `Crime activity in 23220`, `Houses price in 23220`, `Does 23220 have light rail or bike trails` is a lot of research and important information will get lost in between as there is a lot of processing before saving the important information which is usually in the head(never a good place for all the data just searched)

## Need Why this Project?
* A User who wants to get information such as `Crime Activity`, `House Price`, `Is their light rail`, `Open Jobs`, or etc in a specific zip code is a lot of work to do as a single user googling and searching up on each individual site. So this application will have all important data such as Safety rating, Education, Diversity, Police Coverage, Transportation methods, housing market for zip codes in a county and a bigger state

## Context, scope and perspective
### Context
* With how the data mentioned above is scattered all over the internet the goal of this project to put everything in one database so that all teh data for a zip code can be accessed with a single api call or can also do specific queries for each entities attributes


### Scope
* The scope of the project encompasses the development and maintenance of a comprehensive database aimed at aggregating and presenting data relevant to living conditions across various counties in Virginia. The database will cover a multitude of aspects including education, housing, employment, crime activity, transportation, and population metrics. It's designed to be a one-stop resource for individuals seeking to explore and analyze living conditions in Virginia, whether for short-term or permanent relocation. The scope extends to providing an accessible and user-friendly interface for querying this data, as well as ensuring the data is well-organized, up-to-date, and reliable.



### Perspective
* End User <br>
  The database serves as an invaluable tool for making informed decisions regarding relocation. They can easily compare different zip codes based on their preferences such as rent prices, bike routes, and safety, among other criteria. The project simplifies the research process by aggregating all necessary data into one platform, saving time and ensuring they have all the information needed to make a well-informed decision.
* Developer <br>
  From a developer's standpoint, the project requires a robust backend database system to handle a variety of data types and queries efficiently. It also necessitates a front-end interface that is intuitive and user-friendly. There's a continuous need for data updates, monitoring, and possibly expanding the database to encompass more data or cover additional areas over time.

1. EducationSystem Table:

        ZipCode -> PublicSchoolNumbers<br>
        ZipCode -> QualityOfSchools<br>
        ZipCode -> Diversity<br>

2. Criminal Activity Table:

        ZipCode -> SafetyRating<br>
        ZipCode -> NumberofCrimes<br>
        ZipCode -> CrimeType<br>

3. Population Table:

        ZipCode -> PopulationNumber<br>
        ZipCode -> Diversity<br>

4. Transportation Table:

        ZipCode -> bikeRoutes<br>
        ZipCode -> hasLightTrains<br>

5. HouseMarket Table:

        ZipCode -> AvgRent<br>
        ZipCode -> AvgPrice<br>
        ZipCode -> housesForSale<br>

6. JobSecurity Table:

        ZipCode -> numOpenJobs<br>
        ZipCode -> layoffRate<br>

Forth Normal Form (4NF)

* Decompose multi-valued attributes like safety Rating and decomposing the values needed to calculate for the table other than that the other tables are **4NF** form
