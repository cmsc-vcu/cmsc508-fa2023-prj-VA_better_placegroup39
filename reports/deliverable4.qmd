## Project overview and key deliverables
"VA Better Place" focuses on creating a comprehensive database that assesses the quality of living conditions in different ZIP codes within Virginia. This project aims to provide valuable insights into education, employment, housing, crime activity, transportation, and population data, ultimately aiding residents, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions to enhance the overall quality of life in the state.

## Problem Description 

**Problem Domain:**

The problem domain of Virginia Better Place revolves around improving the living conditions in different zip codes across the state of Virginia. This encompasses a wide range of aspects including education, housing, employment, crime activity, transportation, and population demographics. To understand this domain, one must consider the unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities present in each zip code. For instance, some zip codes may have thriving job markets but inadequate public transportation, while others may excel in education but struggle with high crime rates.

**Need:**

The need for the Virginia Better Place database arises from the desire to comprehensively assess living conditions across Virginia. This database aims to provide valuable insights into each zip code, helping policymakers, local governments, researchers, and residents make informed decisions. By centralizing data on education, housing, employment, crime activity, transportation, and population, this database will help identify areas that require improvements, allocate resources more effectively, and create a better quality of life for Virginia residents.

**Context, Scope, and Perspective:**

The Virginia Better Place database is designed to serve multiple perspectives, including policymakers, local governments, researchers, residents, and community organizations. Each user role has a unique perspective:

1. **Policymakers and Local Governments:** These users seek data to make informed policy decisions and allocate resources for community development.
2. **Researchers:** Researchers can use the database to conduct studies and gain insights into socio-economic factors affecting different regions.
3. **Residents:** Residents can access the database to understand the quality of life in their area, helping them make informed choices about where to live and work.
4. **Community Organizations:** Non-profits and community organizations can use the data to identify areas in need of assistance and plan initiatives accordingly.

**User Roles and Use Cases:**

- **Policymakers:** These users may need access to various data points to inform policies related to education, public transportation, or crime reduction.
- **Researchers:** Researchers might perform data analysis, studying correlations between different living conditions.
- **Residents:** Residents could use the database to compare zip codes when considering a new home or assessing the safety of a neighborhood.
- **Community Organizations:** Non-profit organizations could use the data to target their assistance and outreach programs effectively.

**Security and Privacy:**

Security and privacy are paramount in the Virginia Better Place database. As it contains sensitive data about living conditions, ensuring data security and privacy is crucial. The following measures will be implemented:

- User Authentication: Users will require secure authentication to access specific data.
- Data Encryption: Data transmission and storage will be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- Access Controls: Different user roles will have specific access rights to ensure that sensitive data is protected.

Overall, the Virginia Better Place database will serve as a valuable tool for understanding and improving the living conditions in Virginia, benefiting a wide range of users and helping to address the unique challenges in different zip codes.

The decision to employ a Chen diagram in the database design is centered on the selection of ZIP codes as the primary key. This choice is particularly apt when working with geographic data, as ZIP codes serve as unique identifiers for different regions. Chen diagrams offer a visually appealing and intuitive representation of the database schema, making it easier to illustrate relationships among entities, attributes, and keys. This visual approach enhances comprehension and facilitates communication, especially with non-technical stakeholders.

Despite the advantages of Chen diagrams, it's essential to acknowledge potential tradeoffs. These diagrams can become complex when dealing with intricate relationships or extensive datasets, necessitating careful organization to maintain clarity. Additionally, as the database evolves, updating and maintaining the diagram to reflect changes can be a manual and time-consuming process. While Chen diagrams effectively illustrate relationships, they do not provide insights into the database's normalization level. Therefore, it is crucial to supplement the diagram with processes such as functional dependencies and normalization to ensure data integrity and efficiency in the database structure.



**Relational schemas**

 Listing of relations, their attributes, types, domain, and constraints, identification of the primary key and foreign keys and other constraints.

**Functional Dependencies and Normalization**

 A discussion of the functional dependencies in the proposed database schema, and a demonstration of the  normalization of the relations to BCNF/4NF. This might consist of a description, in a text format, of the process of decomposing the tables extracted from the ERD translation into relations satisfying BCNF/4NF. Note that your decomposition via BCNF/4NF must be lossless.

**Specific queries**

20 distinct questions that the database can help answer. These can be general queries of use to all the users, or specific queries for different users or user roles. These questions should be written in precise words and using relational algebra

**Sample Data**

5-10 tuples in each relation, to clearly communicate the domains of each attribute.
